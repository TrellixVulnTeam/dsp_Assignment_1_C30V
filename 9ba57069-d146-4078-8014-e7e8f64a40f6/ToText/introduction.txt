An Introduction to ‘A Virtual Passover’
Since the frightful night in Egypt over 3,000 years ago when ancient Israel spread blood from the sacrificial
lamb on their lintels and doorposts to the present day, Passover has carried major significance to Jews throughout
the world. But Passover also has much significance in the traditions of Christians and Latter-day Saints. This
