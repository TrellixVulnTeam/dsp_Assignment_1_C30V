THE MEANING OF THE PASSOVER SYMBOLS
By Kimberly Rogers
Passover is traditionally viewed as a Jewish holiday. It is, rather, a Biblical Feast that has been performed the
same way for over 3,500 years starting with the Hebrews and Gentiles that left Egypt together during the first Exodus
(Exodus 12:38).
Several items are placed on the Passover Seder (supper) plate. Each of these has specific meaning
associated with our Messiah, Yeshua, and the Children of Abraham, also referred to as The Children of Israel.
Passover, as with all the Feasts, are associated with prophecies of Yeshua, both for His first coming and His
second. There is great knowledge associated with the symbolism of the Passover and wonderful blessings for Believers
who keep God¶s appointed times (moedim: pronounced mow-ed-eem) ± the times He said we were to have ³an
appointment´ with Him.
Lamb Shank bone:
The unbroken, unblemished shank bone reminds us of Yeshua¶s crucifixion in that it always remains an
unbroken bone. During Roman times, ALL crucified people were to have their leg bones broken, but God gave the
Messiah¶s unbroken legs as one of the signs of His identity because the Passover Lamb¶s bones were never broken
(Exodus 12:46 and Numbers 9:12). Yeshua is our Passover Lamb.
John 19:36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
So, it is that this bone represents first the miracle of the unbroken legs of our Messiah. Second, the shank bone
also represents the outstretched arm of Adonai during the first Exodus, but even more astounding it represents how He
will deliver us during the second Exodus yet to come. The second Exodus is referred to in Jeremiah 23:
Jeremiah 23:7 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD
liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
8 But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country,
and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.
So, the shank bone refers to God¶s deliverance of His people at both ends of the ages.
Matzah (Unleavened Bread):
Unleavened bread has the properties in its appearance of being beaten, striped and bruised. For the last 3,500
years, these have represented Yeshua¶s physical state at the time of His crucifixion.
Each Seder table is provided with 3 Matzahs hidden in a 3-pocketed ³napkin´. One whole piece of Matzah is
placed in each pocket. The 3 Matzah¶s represent God¶s 3 manifestations as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The first
Matzah represents God, the Father. The middle Matzah represents Yeshua. At a point during the ritual, middle Matzah
is broken, then hidden by adults to be found by children later at a specified time. The Matzah, Yeshua who is our
unleavened bread, was broken for our sins, wrapped in a white burial cloth, placed in a tomb (hidden), and then arose
from the dead (was found again).The hidden Matzah is called the ³afikomen´, a Greek word meaning ³that which comes
rd
last´. It also represents Yeshua¶s final return to earth. The 3 Matzah represents the Holy Spirit.
Maror (Bitter Herbs):
Maror symbolizes the bitter lot of the Israelites during their enslavement in Egypt, but it also symbolizes the
bondage and burdens we experience while living in the world (spiritual Egypt) before we asked Yeshua to accept us into
His Kingdom.
Karpas & Salt Water:
The salt water is also used to symbolize the tears the Israelites shed while in slavery and the water they passed
through when God divided the Red Sea. This passing through the Red Sea was the second step in their salvation
process. The first was, of course, the acceptance of the Passover Lamb. All Believers are baptized as a confirmation of
passing from one way of life ± Gentile ways ± to God¶s way of life ± Hebrew ways.
1 Corinthians 10:2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
