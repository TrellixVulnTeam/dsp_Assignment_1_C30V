The Passover Seder
Experience Handbook

O

ne of the most memorable highlights of the Jewish year is Seder Night, the night
on which Jewish households unite to celebrate the nation’s redemption from
Egypt. It is a celebration of the Jewish national identity on the night that our nation
came into being. In fact, the prophet Yechezkel (Ezekiel 16:4) calls Passover “the day
of your birth.” More than just a “birthday party” though, the essence of Seder Night
is to integrate and internalize the most fundamental themes of Judaism. The story
of the birth of our nation, retold each year as presented in the Haggadah, forms the
backbone of our faith, our identity, and our hope. In this class we will discuss the
various aspects of Seder Night, as seen through the prism of the Torah, the Haggadah,
and the words of our Sages.

This class will address the following questions:
 Why do we celebrate the Passover Seder? What is it meant to accomplish?
 Why are children a focus of the Seder?
 Why does this night contain a wealth of mitzvot and customs, more so than
any other day of the year?
 Why is Seder Night always the same (same food, same story, etc.)? How can
this year’s Seder be more interesting than last year’s?
 What are the messages of the Pesach offering, matzah, maror, and the Four
Cups of wine?
 What is behind the custom of filling a cup of wine for Eliyahu (Elijah) and
opening the door for him?
